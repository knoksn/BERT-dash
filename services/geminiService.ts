Rules:
1.  Extract meaningful question-and-answer pairs from the text.
2.  If the text is sparse or lacks clear Q&A content, generate plausible examples relevant to DarkBERT's domain (e.g., explaining malware types, describing hacking techniques, defining dark web terminology).
3.  Ensure the output is a valid JSON array of objects.
4.  Each object must have two keys: "prompt" (the question) and "completion" (the answer).
5.  Generate at least 5 pairs, but no more than 10.
